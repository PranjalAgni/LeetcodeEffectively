// Time: O(N) | Space: O(1)
// Things to know here:
// 1.If the last digit of a binary number is 1, the number is odd; if itâ€™s 0, the number is even.
// 2. Removing the least significant bit (rightmost bit) means dividing the binary number by 2
// 3. Adding to binary number means adding 1 bit to LSB and then performing carry operation
